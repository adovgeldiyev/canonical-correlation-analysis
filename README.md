# Canonical-correlation-analysis<br>
### Performed in R <br>
Canonical Correlation Analysis on the Young People Survey from Lab 2: PCA/FA. Perform a canonical correlation analysis describing the relationships between the hobbies_interests and music variables.<br>

a. Test the null hypothesis that the canonical correlations are all equal to zero. Give your test statistic, d.f., and p-value.<br>
b. How many significant canonical variates are there?<br>
c. Present the first two canonical correlations (Cancor)?<br>
d. What can you conclude from the above analyses?<br>
2.canonical variates.<br>
a. Give the formulae for the first canonical variate for the hobbies_interests and music variables.<br>
b. Give the correlations between the first canonical variate for hobbies_interests and the music variables.<br>
c. What can you conclude from the above analyses?<br>
